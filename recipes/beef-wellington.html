    <h2><em>Juicy, tender and succulent!</em></h2>
        <P>Only <strong>5 parts</strong> to make this dish that will leave you wanting for more! Lets start from the inside and work our way towards the outside.</P>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef tenderloin</li>
            <li>Duxelle (finely chopped mixed mushrooms)</li>
            <li>Prosciutto di Parma</li>
            <li>Crepe 16" x 12"</li>
            <li>2x puff pastry 16" x 12"</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare a 20 cm cut of beef tenderloin, season it well with salt and wrap with plastic. Rest for 2 hours to allow the salt to penetrate the meat. Afterwards, sear on all sides over high heat and allow to rest.</li>
            <li>Choose mushrooms of your liking and chop finely. Cook in a pan to remove the moisture and put aside. </li>
            <li>Start with a crepe that is 16" x 12" and cover with thin slices of Prosciutto di Parma.</li>
            <li>Evenly spread a thin layer of duxelle all over the crepe.</li>
            <li>Place the beef tenderloin on top of the duxelle and tightly wrap it in the crepe.</li>
            <li>Wrap the whole crepe in plastic wrap and further wrap by twisting the ends of the plastic wrap (the tigher the better!). Rest in refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Lay out the puff pastry and brush the inside with a thin layer of egg wash. Wrap the crepe well and trim with a knife leaving enough pastry on the side to seal with a fork.</li>
            <li>Fold the sides of the puff pastry under and apply egg wash all over the outside.</li>
            <li>(Optional)Lattic shape decoration with the under puff pastry. Trim the decoration to size and apply egg wash.</li>
            <li>Season the top with course ground sea salt which will help to crust up the puff pastry even more.</li>
            <li>Bake the beef wellington on a baking tray at 400 Fahrenheit for 20-25 minutes for a medium rare cook. Internal temperature should be around 118 Fahrenheit. Always remember to allow time for rest before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
